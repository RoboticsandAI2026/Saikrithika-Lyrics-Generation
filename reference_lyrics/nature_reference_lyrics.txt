Verse 1:
The forest whispers secrets in the breeze
Mountains stand tall, embracing ancient trees
The river sings a song of endless flow
Nature's beauty sets my soul aglow

Chorus:
Oh, the earth, so wild and free
Blooming meadows, vast and green
In the heart of nature's embrace
I find my peace, my sacred place

Verse 2:
The dawn awakens with a golden hue
The ocean dances under skies so blue
The pine trees sway in twilight's gentle glow
In nature's arms, my spirit seems to grow

Bridge:
When the world feels heavy, I turn to the land
The valley's song, the touch of sand
The earth reminds me who I am
A child of nature, free to stand

Verse 3:
The stars above reflect the lake's calm sheen
The meadow blooms where life has always been
With every step, the earth and I are one
Nature's story shines beneath the sun

Chorus:
Oh, the earth, so wild and free
Blooming meadows, vast and green
In the heart of nature's embrace
I find my peace, my sacred place

Outro:
As the wind carries dreams across the plain
Nature's voice will call my name again
In her beauty, I will always roam
The earth, my heart, my endless home
