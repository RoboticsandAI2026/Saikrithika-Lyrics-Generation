Verse 1:
Breaking chains beneath the open sky
I spread my wings, I'm born to fly
The road ahead is mine to roam
Freedom's call will lead me home

Chorus:
Free at last, my spirit soars
Chasing dreams through open doors
Liberty, my heart's own song
With freedom's light, I will belong

Verse 2:
No walls can hold this burning flame
The wind will whisper out my name
I run where rivers carve their way
In freedom's arms, I'll seize the day

Bridge:
When the shadows try to bind my soul
I'll rise above, I'll take control
The sky is vast, the world is wide
With freedom, I will not subside

Verse 3:
Every step, I claim my right to be
Unbound, unbowed, eternally free
The horizon calls with endless light
I'll dance with stars through every night

Chorus:
Free at last, my spirit soars
Chasing dreams through open doors
Liberty, my heart's own song
With freedom's light, I will belong

Outro:
As the dawn breaks, I will run
To the place where skies and dreams are one
Freedom's path, my heart will roam
Forever free, I'll find my home
