In every battle, we face the storm
Our friendship's strength will never bend
A loyal heart, my truest friend

Through joy and sorrow, sunshine and rain
We'll lift each other, never let go
Our friendship's roots will only grow

With every step, I'm grateful for you
My friend, my heart, my strength, my truth
